        <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>This website was created for students of Elizabethtown College to enter information about their pets, in the form of a profile. This site will be used to keep track of all of the pets that live on campus, in the case of one going missing, so other students can keep a lookout for the missing animal to help find them. </p>
