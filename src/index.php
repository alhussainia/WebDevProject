        <h2> About Us: </h2>
            <p> The Elizabethtown College's Pet Profiles website was created for the students of ETown College and their pets.
                This website will allow students with a Service Animal (SA), Emotional Support Animal (ESA), or an Assitance Animal (AA) to create
                a profile for their pet. It will also allow students to post lost or found animals on campus. This website was 
                made to help the students on campus with ESAs or AAs find their pets faster when they have been lost. Also, 
                we hope to spread more awareness about these animals, their roles, and how important they are to their owners. 
            </p>
